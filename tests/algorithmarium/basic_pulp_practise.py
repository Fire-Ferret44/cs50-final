"""
First practise with small model and how to use pulp

Model: Weekday (incl Fri) Night Shifts with 3 Doctors (A, B, C)
- Days: Monâ€“Fri (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
- Shifts: 16:00 to 08:00 (next morning)
- One doctor per night
- Max two shifts per week
- No back-to-back shifts
- Doctor B prefers to avoid Tuesday
