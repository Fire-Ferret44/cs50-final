    <header class="heading">Welcome to the Call Roster Generator</header>
    <p class="standard">
        This is a webapp dedicated to roster shift calendars, timetables or similar problems that have multiple participants and constraints.
        It allows you to create a roster for your team, taking into account various constraints and preferences.
        The roster can be generated based on the input you provide, and you can download it in various formats.
        <br><br>
        It might not be initially obvious how to interact with the site so please go to the tutorial page first.
        <br><br>
        The site is built in a modular way and parameters can be adjusted, but the current "standard" model used as an example is for a working hours plus overtime call schedule and
        is as follows:
    </p>
    <p class="list">
        <b>Monday - Thursday:</b> 1x 16h00-20h00, 1x 16h00-10h00+<br>
        <b>Friday:</b> 2x 16h00-08h00+<br>
        <b>Saturday:</b> 2x 08h00-08h00+<br>
        <b>Sunday:</b> 2x 08h00-10h00+<br>
    </p>
    <p class="standard">
